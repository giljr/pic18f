### Why PIC? :heart_eyes:
PIC (usually pronounced as "pick") is a family of microcontrollers made by [Microchip Technolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microchip_Technology).
In 2000, Microchip introduced the PIC18 architecture. it has proven to be very popular, with a large number of device variants presently in manufacture. C has become the predominant development language.


In this series I will bring to you how to code PIC pastile in C all from the beginning. 

Welcome!
